Instruction for making a sample request to gRPC server:

1. Prequisites: udaConnect app is up and python installed in the local environment 

2. Navigate to modules/grpc_api folder

3. If grpctools is not yet installed in the local environment, run: 
   pip install grpcio-tools

4. See main.py for gRPC server details. It runs on the `udaconnect-grpc-api` pod  

5. The url for sending a request is `localhost:30005`. To post a sample payload, run: 
   python writer_loc.py
   
   Tip 1: person_id in the sample data must already exist in Postgres `person` table 
   Tip 2: to see server messages, run: kubectl logs --tail=50 <udaconnect-grpc-api pod> 
   
6. To view the new data, either:
   - use Postman (see location requests in docs/postman.json), or
   - query Postgres `location` table (port: 5432 inside Postgres pod or 31432 from outside)

Happy testing :)
